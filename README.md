Module 1
Overview of Project: Analyze the theatre campaign outcomes by their launch date and then further analysing a sub-category "plays" of the theatre category by their successful, failed and canceled percentages

Analysis and Challenges: 
Analysis:
- May and June were the most successful months for the theatre campaign and december the least successful. 
- Lesser the campaign goal amount the more successful it was. 

Callenges: 
I did not face any major challenges however here are two points worth mentioning:
- Ensuring to make no spelling errors while typing the sheet name / row & column names
- Ensuring to count the number of rows. and columns expected to match with the required result and graphs

Results:
1. - May and June were the most successful launch months for the theatre campaign
   - December was the least successful month and success and failed numbers were almost equal

2. - More than 75% of the campaigns under subcategory "plays" were successful when the goal amount was less than $1000
   - When goal amount was more than 15000 the failed fate was more than success except between 35000 to 45000. 

3. - The dates were not provided in actual date format
   - More backer information like age group / gender could have helped understand the semantic
