Module 1
Overview of Project: Analyze the theatre campaign outcomes by their launch date and then further analysing a sub-category "plays" of the theatre category by their successful, failed and canceled percentages

Analysis and Challenges: 
Analysis:
- May and June were the most successful months for the theatre campaign and december the least successful. 
- Lesser the campaign goal amount the more successful it was. 

Callenges: 
I did not face any major challenges however here are two points worth mentioning:
- Ensuring to make no spelling errors while typing the sheet name / row & column names
- Ensuring to count the number of rows. and columns expected to match with the required result and graphs

Results:

i)  Two conclusions drawn about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:
    - May and June were the most successful launch months for the theatre campaign
    - December was the least successful month as well as success and failed numbers were almost equal

ii) Outcomes based on Goals conclusion:
    - More than 75% of the campaigns under subcategory "plays" were successful when the goal amount was less than $1000
    - When goal amount was more than 15000 the failed fate was more than success except between 35000 to 45000. 

iii) Some limitations of this datasets are:
     - The dates were not provided in actual date format
     - More backer information like age group / gender could have helped understand the semantic

iv) Other possible analysis graphs:
   - Total success rate based on Countries
   - Success rate based on Categories
